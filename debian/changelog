mobile-usb-networking (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * network-setup: exit on first failure
  * d/postinst: don't error out if connection can't be created.
    There are cases (image creation, for example) where the connection
    creation script is expected to fail. Let's not error out when that
    happens but rather enable the systemd service for setting up the
    connection on first boot.
