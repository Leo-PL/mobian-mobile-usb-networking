mobile-usb-networking (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * mobile-usb-network-setup.service: fix startup condition
    `ConditionFirstBoot` is true when `/etc/machine-id` doesn't exist.
    However, we ship images with an existing, but empty file instead,
    meaning the service won't start in such cases.
    Let's change the condition to make the service run when the NM
    connection file is missing.

mobile-usb-networking (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * network-setup: exit on first failure
  * d/postinst: don't error out if connection can't be created.
    There are cases (image creation, for example) where the connection
    creation script is expected to fail. Let's not error out when that
    happens but rather enable the systemd service for setting up the
    connection on first boot.
